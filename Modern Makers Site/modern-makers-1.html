					<h2 class="sa" id="start-sa"><a href="http://www.sharlaineanapu.com">Sharlaine Anapu</a></h2>
					<p class="sa">
						Born and raised in New Zealand, Sharlaine is strongly influenced by her cultures - both Pacific and European.
					<br>
					<br>
						The conceptual aspect of her designs gravitate naturally towards the simplicity of lines and forms.  Much of this influence stems from growing up close to the ocean and a profound appreciation for nature.  Blackened materials emit subdued and muted tones, an ongoing narrative she explores in her pieces. Other pieces combine epoxy resin, paper, wood, and fibrous materials.  I appreciate the imperfections and incomplete forms produced by the combination of the materials.

					<br>

						After creating each pattern, with various techniques such as pen drawing, linoleum carving and stencil cutting, the designs are screenprinted onto certified organic fabric with eco-friendly water-based ink.
