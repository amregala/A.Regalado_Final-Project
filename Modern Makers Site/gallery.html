    <p class="makers-mart-description"> Makers Mart is a two day event held at the National Museum of Women in the Arts inspired by and organized to promote women makers and artists in the local creative community.  Part of the NMWAs mission is to introduce and advocate women artists to the public. In an effort to help connect and introduce women makers and artists to a larger audience the Makers Mart was conceived. The intent behind Makers Mart is to promote and showcases local women makers, artists, crafters, and designers alike and allow for the community to meet, connect and support talented local women - all of whom create hand-crafted merchandise including jewelry, fine art, home accents, and personal accessories.
